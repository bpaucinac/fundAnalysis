### 6.3 Key Time Period Observations

- **Performance Evolution**: PGTIX slightly outperformed QQQ in the early period (11/2016 - 07/2019) by 0.67%, but significantly underperformed in the middle period (08/2019 - 04/2022) by -44.89% and continued to underperform in the late period (05/2022 - 02/2025) by -11.53%.

- **Correlation Stability**: The correlation between PGTIX and QQQ has remained relatively stable over time, increasing slightly from 0.86 in the early period to 0.90 in the late period.

- **Alpha Trend**: PGTIX's alpha has deteriorated over time, from -1.38% annually in the early period to a dramatic -12.85% in the middle period, recovering somewhat to -2.95% in the late period.

- **Consistent Long-Term Underperformance**: PGTIX has shown negative excess returns across all rolling periods analyzed. The longer the time horizon, the more consistent and pronounced the underperformance becomes.

- **Decreasing Outperformance Frequency**: As the measurement window increases from 12 months to 60 months, the percentage of time PGTIX outperforms QQQ drops dramatically from 33% to just 7%, suggesting that long-term investors would almost certainly experience underperformance.

- **Middle Period Divergence**: The most dramatic underperformance occurred during the middle period (08/2019 - 04/2022), which coincides with the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent tech rally, suggesting that PGTIX particularly struggles in tech-driven bull markets.

## 7. Key Conclusions

1. **Performance vs Benchmark**: PGTIX has underperformed QQQ over the full period, with the underperformance becoming more pronounced in recent years and over longer time horizons.

2. **Consistency**: While PGTIX outperformed QQQ in 50% of individual months, longer-term performance (1-5 years) shows consistent underperformance. This suggests that the fund occasionally outperforms in the short term but struggles to maintain this advantage.

3. **Market Environments**: PGTIX underperforms in both up markets (capture ratio 0.95) and down markets (capture ratio 1.10), providing neither superior returns in bull markets nor effective downside protection in bear markets.

4. **Skill vs Luck**: The persistent negative alpha across all time periods (deteriorating from -1.38% to -12.85% before improving to -2.95% annually) and negative information ratios suggest structural rather than coincidental underperformance.

5. **Distinctiveness**: PGTIX returns are somewhat distinct from QQQ with a correlation of 0.88 and beta of 1.12, but this distinctiveness has not translated into superior performance. The correlation has slightly increased over time (from 0.86 to 0.90), suggesting the fund is becoming more similar to its benchmark.

6. **Return Distribution**: The overall performance differential results from consistent small differences rather than extreme outliers, though the middle period (08/2019 - 04/2022) shows a particularly severe performance gap.

7. **Time Period Consistency**: The fundamental characteristics of underperformance hold across different time periods, especially for longer investment horizons. While there was slight outperformance in the early period, the long-term pattern of underperformance has been remarkably persistent.

## 8. Investment Implications

1. **Long-Term Investors**: Based on the rolling window analysis, investors with a time horizon of 3+ years would have only a 7-19% chance of outperforming by choosing PGTIX over QQQ, making it difficult to justify an allocation to this fund for long-term investors.

2. **Higher Risk Without Reward**: PGTIX consistently exhibits higher volatility than QQQ (overall 6.88% vs 5.45% monthly standard deviation) while delivering lower returns, creating an unfavorable risk-return profile.

3. **Lack of Diversification Benefit**: With its relatively high correlation to QQQ (0.88 overall, increasing to 0.90 in recent periods) and negative alpha, PGTIX does not provide meaningful diversification benefits that would justify its inclusion in a portfolio alongside or in place of QQQ.

4. **Market Environment Considerations**: The fund's worst relative performance occurred during the strong tech rally following the COVID-19 market downturn, suggesting it may continue to struggle in tech-led bull markets.
